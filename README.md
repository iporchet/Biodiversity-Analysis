# Biodiversity-Analysis
This project was to interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.
   
I performed data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigated if there were any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, I analyzed, cleaned, and ploted data as well as posed questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.
